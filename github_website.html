				<h3>As We May Think</h3>
				<p>Technology has acted like an extension of our physical body, and now it is an extension of our minds. In As We May Think, the author says that the application of science has given us the power of record in order to analyze our past mistakes and break the cycle of repetition and solve present problems. I found that observation to be interesting because I haven't viewed science and technology as a betterment to our being in that way. Sure, it makes life easier and more convient but I now see that tech gives us the resources to also face our lives with more wisdom gained from history. This article made me think about how we would use technology in the future. In my mind, I feel like humanity has used technology to its fullest potential because I can't imagine it being used in areas of my life that it already isn't present. So I guess I expect future technology to just build on what we have now. There is always room for improvement and humans by nature never seem to be satisfied so technology will continue to progress to what we think is perfection. </p>
				<h3>Long Life the Web</h3>
				<p>Access to the web and interent should be free for all as well as accessible to all people. As companies come in to use technology as a means to make money and intentionally or unintentionally discriminate groups of users, it is society's job to protect ourselves. Our data is being sold by big companies and we're vulnerable to various forms of censorship and bias information online. Information should be shared freely and easily because the Information Age allowed us to learn more about our world that we couldn't previously acess as easily as we do. If we become inhibited in our search and barred from that information again, I feel like our society will go backwards.  </p>
