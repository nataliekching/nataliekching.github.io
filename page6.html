        <h3 style="color:black; background-color:white">I thought that the art piece gave off an eerie feel in the way it used only black and white as well as silhouettes of men and objects. There wasn't a direct storyline, so I thought giving the audience a chance to interact with the piece was very unique so that eveyone can have an individualized experience with the art. When I began interacting with the piece, I was a little confused because I never interacted with something like this before but I found the experience suspenseful because I wasn't sure what would be after each click.<br>-Natalie </h3>
