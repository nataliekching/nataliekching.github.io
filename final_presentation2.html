  <h1 style="padding-top: 260px;">The homepage would showcase a grid of pictures <br> and there would be a navigation bar that says fashion, <br> beauty, runway, and culture. Each topic would contain at <br> least one webpage related to the topic. My inspiration for <br> this final is other fashion websites like Vogue <br> and Harper's BAZAAR </h1>
