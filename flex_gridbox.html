    <h2>The Ecstasy of Communication by Jean Baudrillard (Reading Response)</h2>
  </div>
  <div class="flex-container">
    <h3>Jean Baudrillard made an interesting point about how the loss of private space correlates with the loss of public space. Those subjects are complete opposites but I feel like the two don't exactly disappear, they intertwine to the point where you can't tell one from the other. I feel like with the popularity of social media and consumerism, companies are more intrusive in order to find out our wants and needs. This outcome is inevitable because our world is constantly growing with the intent of building audiences and loyal consumers in the market to contribute to the economy. I feel like the world needs a distinction between public and private nonetheless because a lack of private space will create a less authentic environment because everyone will feel like they are always being watched. </h3>
